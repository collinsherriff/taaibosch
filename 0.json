  "description": "A blend of 65% Cabernet Franc, 30% Merlot, and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, matured in a combination of 225-litre oak barrels, 9 000-liter foudre, and 4 500-liter cement tanks. Engaging aromatics of red berries, some leafiness, and pencil shavings precede a palate that is medium-bodied (alcohol is 13.5%) with good freshness and fine, chalky tannins. It combines clarity of fruit with a pleasing tension and comes across as both elegant and understated. This majestic estate is situated at the foot of the Helderberg Mountain, with panoramic views stretching to Cape Point, Table Mountain, Robben Island and the Stellenbosch Hills. Here the vineyards are planted at an altitude of 300 meters above sea level, facing False Bay to the South West. It is this unique location and positioning which provides the vineyards with the gentle cooling sea breezes, which enables optimal slow ripening during the summer months.",
